**Higgs Boson Challenge**
This project involves the analysis and prediction of particle collisions using data from the ATLAS detector at CERN. The dataset was provided through a Kaggle competition, aiming to distinguish between a signal process producing Higgs bosons and background noise. The work includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize prediction accuracy.
__Project Outline_
Data Download & Preprocessing: Initial steps involve cleaning the data and handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analysis to understand the feature set and identify patterns.
Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated.
Model Tuning: Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to enhance the model's performance.
Final Report: The best-performing model and its metrics were summarized.
